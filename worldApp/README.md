This is the first assignment of the discoverthreejs.com tutorial.
the assignment is as follows:

Easy#
Change the color of the scene background. You can enter any standard color name such as red, green, purple, and so on, as well as some unusual names like aquamarine or coral. How many of the 140 CSS color names can you guess?

Medium#
Change the cube to some other shapes like a rectangle, sphere, triangle, or torus. (Hint: search the docs for “BufferGeometry”.)

Add a second cube and move it around using mesh.position.set(x, y, z) (you’ll either need to figure out some way of returning two cubes from the createCube function, or add a second module like cube2.js).

Hard#
This is a challenge for people who are already familiar with building websites. If you are new to web development, it’s OK to skip this one.

Add a button to the HTML page, and delay rendering the scene until the button has been clicked. Do this without making any changes to the World app. Instead, create the button in index.html and set it up in main.js.
